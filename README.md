# Yolo-Custom-Object-Detection
• Developed machine learning model for multiple object detection in a single frame from CCTV camera footage
• Got the real time data of object used in production hence capturing the data automatically
• Trained the model using of production video, identified objects and lables on Yolo custom model Training
• Modified the model for many classes (multiple objects) and adjusted batch size, epochs, activation function
of different Neural Network Layers for minimal losses. Tested and implemented model at production site
